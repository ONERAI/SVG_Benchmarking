## Benchmarking methods for identification of spatially variable genes

Spatially resolved transcriptomics allows for profiling gene expression of cells while preserving their spatial context, adding a new axis to the data. One key challenge of analyzing such data is to identify spatially variable genes. Several methods have been developed for this task based on different assumptions.
