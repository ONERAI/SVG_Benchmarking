## Benchmarking methods for identification of spatially variable genes

Spatially resolved transcriptomics enables the profiling of gene expression in cells while maintaining their spatial context, thereby introducing a new dimension to the data. An essential step in analyzing such data involves identifying genes that exhibit varying expression patterns across space. A variety of computational methods have been developed with diverse strategies and assumptions to accomplish this task. However, the absence of a benchmark on the performance of these methods hinders their effective use. We here present a systematic evaluation of 13 methods on XXX simulated and XXX real-world spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by imaging-based or sequencing-based technologies.


We aim to address following question

* Are the methods robust to different spatial patterns?
* Which method have the best performance?
* When applied to real data, do they give consistent results?
* How is scalibility and usability of each method?
