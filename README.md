## Benchmarking methods for identification of spatially variable genes

Spatially resolved transcriptomics enables the profiling of gene expression in cells while maintaining their spatial context, thereby introducing a new dimension to the data. A crucial aspect of analyzing this type of data involves identifying genes that vary in expression across space. To achieve this, various methods have been devised, each based on different assumptions.
